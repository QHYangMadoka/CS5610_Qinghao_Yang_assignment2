# Conway's Game of Life

## About This Project
This project was developed individually by Qinghao Yang as part of an assignment to implement Conway's Game of Life in React. The project makes use of the following packages and libraries:

- `react` and `react-dom`: Core libraries for building the app.
- `react-router-dom`: For implementing routing between pages.
- `react-bootstrap` and `bootstrap`: For styling and layout components.
- `react-scripts`: For managing the React development and build processes.

The app is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life, featuring customizable grids, interactive controls, and advanced cell behaviors.

## Write-Up

### Challenges Faced
One of the biggest challenges was managing the grid's dynamic updates and ensuring efficient state management. Implementing clustered setups and "longer-lasting cells" required careful consideration of performance and logic to avoid excessive computation. Another challenge was resolving Git conflicts during collaboration with the remote repository, which consumed additional time.

### Additional Features
With more time, I would enhance the app with:
- A more visually appealing heatmap gradient for cell states.
- Support for importing and exporting grid configurations.
- Real-time performance optimization for larger grid sizes.

### Assumptions Made
While working on this assignment, I assumed that users would primarily interact with the app on desktop browsers. Additionally, I assumed that the clustered setup algorithm could focus on proximity-based randomness to form groups.

### Time Spent
This assignment took approximately 20-25 hours to complete, including planning, coding, debugging, and styling.
